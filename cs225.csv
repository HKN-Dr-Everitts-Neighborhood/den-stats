I believe a discussion/recitation for this course would make it 100% better.  The material in ECE110 isn't more difficult than that of my other classes, but the class is MUCH HARDER because of the lack of time with the material.  If you've never taken a circuits class before, it's hard to struggle through some of the concepts.  When i get lost, there is no guidance and i get frustrated.  I think if you included a mandatory discussion section once or twice a week, students would be able to grasp the material more fully and you would see those abominable test scores shoot up.",no previous coursework

There seemed to be a disconnect between the lectures and the labs- the subjects we talked about in the lectures showed up in the labs, but a bit of (verbal) preface to the subject would be appreciated. I recommend, sometime during lecture, saying something like ""when you see this chip in the lab, it will look like..."" or ""in the lab, you'll be using this chip to..."".
