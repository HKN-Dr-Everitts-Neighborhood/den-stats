Spring 2012 Data

So I grabbed these from google docs as xlsx (since that was the easiest way to download them).  Which left me with no good way to read them programmatically, so I cloned https://github.com/dilshod/xlsx2csv, added an __init__.py (empty) at the top level, and used it as a submodule for convertall.py.
